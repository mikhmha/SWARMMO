**Playtest**:  **VERY SOON**

**TRAILER**: Its being made...

Game is so close. Now im implementing the matchmaking system. You take the game world and partition it by some arbitrary division criteria and represent it in code as some data structure contained in a list or kv map. Then you iterate through all of them at some INTERVAL and use some heuristic you figure out based on gameplay to select the best one to spawn incomiing players or ai units into. Its innovative? I don't know all the details yet. IT will come to me in a dream. But it feels like im procrastinating because I really want to launch before October. And NOTHING is coming to me. The implementation is done but I don't know what heuristics to use or what INTERVAL will be the best most fun for players. Part of it involves maximising the rate at which players spawn so you always have people shuffling through = and the assumption is that a very small amount of players will play beyond 1 session, most pop in and out. they are transient participants. and the world meets incoming spawn demand via spawning in some corresponding amount of AI enemies. blah blah. its cool, fun, bandwidth efficient.

ALSO THE WORLD DESIGN will end up changing heavily and better reflective of the partitioning scheme. There is a visual element to it. But will the level design changes happen before launch, after launch, etc? The problem is I LOVE making the map its so fun. Its like painting. But thats the problem. ITS TOO FUN. Hours pass by. And then nothing on the coding side gets done. So I live with whatever the hell the map is right now.  I WANT MORE TREES AND GRASS. There are "primary zones" 0-3 and "transitive zones" A-F. What is the disctinction, does it mean anything? I DONT KNOW YET but i know its legit. And sometimes you can cross between zones and sometimes you can't. But I don't know when.
