# SWARMMO

A new type of free-to-play browser MMO! Featuring high player counts, dynamic AI enemies, and fast-paced combat. 

Battle large groups of enemies with your fellow players and work together to push-back the orc hordes who roam the world seeking to gain new territory and expand their numbers. 






**Playtest**: ~~March 2024~~ April 2024

**Release date**: ~~April 2024~~ May 2024

** UPDATE ** : The release schedule has been delayed by 1 month! Hopefully its the only delay but who knows...
Things are very close. I'm dealing with some challenging problems related to directed graphs, relational algebra, and topology. The final frontier~
Once this part is done, the game will be ready to test and I can also start focusing on adding content. Soon (tm)
